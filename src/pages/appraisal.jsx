                  An appraisal of fine jewelry should be the professional,
                  impartial, qualified opinion of an expert in the fields of
                  gemology <em>and</em> jewelry valuation for a specific
                  purpose. It first requires an accurate representation of the
                  item and its components – the gemstones and mountings – their
                  identification and qualitative grading against industry
                  standards. It then requires the application of relative value
                  through market research appropriate to the item appraised,
                  specific to the intended purpose.

                  Some insurers will even “partner” with dealers, accept that

                  through that dealer, again making more money (yours) from

                  companies are on the lookout for excessive appraisal amounts

                  Your insurance policy (or agent) will explain your coverage
                  limits and conditions pertaining to jewelry. To your
                  homeowners or renters policy you need to add&nbsp;
                  <strong>scheduled property insurance</strong>&nbsp;for
                  individually listed items outside of the generic coverage.
                  Art, antiques, furs and jewelry are typical items so listed
                  because they are of significant individual value and/or need
                  detailed descriptions. The premium you pay is based upon the
                  dollar amount listed, usually from an appraisal. Without this
                  addition, your policy most likely has a limit (often $2500)
                  with a deductible ($500) and covers loss from within the
                  residence. &nbsp;With a scheduled property “rider” or
                  “floater” (terms from transport over land and water in the
                  earlier days of insurance) your coverage now extends to the
                  limit of the appraised value and generally &nbsp;without a
                  deductible for loss anywhere. &nbsp;Be sure to confirm this
                  with your policy, since insurance companies my have different
                  rules. Some companies insure just jewelry or high value items
                  and can be contracted&nbsp;separately.

                  Remember, the insurance company’s obligation is to replace a
                  lost item with one of equal quality, spending what it takes,
                  up to the amount scheduled for that item. Because insurance
                  companies obtain discounts from their replacement sources,
                  they end up paying out less than the typical retail
                  replacement figure states. If you opt for a cash settlement,
                  it will usually be at this lower amount.

                  the independent appraisal comes in. With a qualified
                  appraisal, the insurance company has specific requirements for
                  replacement and you have a document to make sure that happens.
                  The grading of the replacement has to measure up to what was
                  lost, so it should be examined by the same professional

                  This type of valuation may also be appropriate for other

                  However, if an article has changed – such as a new setting,

                  unlike methods of the real estate appraiser, comparable items
                  are used to establish a replacement value. In a{" "}

                  and added together to establish value. Major diamonds are
                  valued from comparable ones in the marketplace and with
                  recognized trade price guides and a markup reflective of the
                  retail environment. Colored stones, on the other hand require
                  extended experience in the field with industry sources for
                  each specific gem and their quality. Price guides are merely
                  that and it is the expertise of the appraiser that really
                  shows here. Mountings in the cost approach reflect metal
                  content, method of manufacture, accent stones and a retail
                  markup.

                  <em>Fair market&nbsp;</em> appraisals reflect the anticipated
                  sale of jewelry. An appraiser will research comparable items
                  in the secondary market, such as auction houses and re-sellers
                  for some items and resort to scrap value on others. This means

                  appraised. And, there is no one standard for fair market
                  value. The IRS definition reflects the price the <em>item</em>{" "}
                  realizes (adding an auction buyer’s premium, for instance)
                  while most other applications reflect the previous{" "}

                  consultation may be all you need. The appraiser can also
