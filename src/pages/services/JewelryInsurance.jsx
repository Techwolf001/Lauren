                  <strong>Insurance appraisal report</strong>&nbsp;includes a
                  competitive and realistic estimated replacement value so your
                  insurance premiums are not inflated and provide adequate
                  information and valuation to settle your claim easily.
                  <br />â€“ Insurance appraisals differ from estate appraisals and
                  market value appraisals. Insurance appraisals are for the sole
                  purpose of duplicating lost, damaged or stolen items.
