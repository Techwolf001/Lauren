                  Litigation sometimes involves jewellery that has been lost, stolen, damaged or destroyed. This prohibits the appraiser from examining the items in their original condition, and often the jewellery cannot be inspected at all. We can help. Our experts can create appraisals by compiling available data, client information, jewellery store records and research in order to establish replacement value while maintaining ethical and professional standards.
