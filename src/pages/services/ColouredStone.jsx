                  gemologists are trained and experienced in identifying a wide
                  range of colored gemstones, from classic precious stones like

                  Our Coloured Stone Identification service involves a thorough
                  examination of your gemstone using a variety of techniques,
                  including visual inspection, magnification, and spectroscopy.
                  We use state-of-the-art equipment to help us identify the
                  unique properties of your stone, such as its chemical
                  composition, crystal structure, and optical characteristics.

                  Once we have identified your stone, we will provide you with a
                  detailed report outlining our findings. Our report includes
                  information about the type of stone, its quality, and any
                  treatments or enhancements that may have been applied. We also
                  provide an estimated value for your stone based on its
                  characteristics and current market conditions.

                  If you are planning to make a large (in excess of $5,000)
                  donation of jewellery to your favourite charity, you will need
                  a donation appraisal report to file with your Federal Income
